20170403_ Kingsley Cross w/ Racketink presents first Responsive Website Work I'm working on within my Sublime text editor to Git to submit to Github.  More updates to come.

It is based on a responsive layout I need to first update because it is not my original design.  It is based on a design I created screenshots of and edited in Photoshop to get the whole layout to edit it in HTML5/CSS3.  The skeleton version of the layout is on it's way.

I just created it as a git page for to view with index.html (same as the first responsiveLayout.html)
